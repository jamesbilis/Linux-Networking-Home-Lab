# Linux Networking Home Lab – Summary

## Completed Components
- Ubuntu Linux installation and baseline configuration
- VMware Workstation NAT networking
- Static IP configuration using netplan
- DHCP reservation configured on the hypervisor (vmnetdhcp.conf)
- Multi-VM environment with isolated network segments
- VLAN concepts implemented using Linux VLAN subinterfaces
- Network segmentation using VMware LAN Segments (VLAN-equivalent)
- Multi-homed Linux router design
- IPv4 forwarding enabled and tested
- Inter-network routing design and troubleshooting

## Key Concepts Learned
- Difference between static IPs and DHCP reservations
- Role of the hypervisor in virtual networking
- Layer 2 vs Layer 3 responsibilities
- VLAN tagging vs VLAN-equivalent segmentation
- Router interface requirements
- Troubleshooting network state and interface mapping
- When to reset state vs continue debugging

## Notes
This lab was intentionally stopped after completing network
segmentation and router design due to hypervisor limitations.
The architecture and troubleshooting process reflect real-world
network engineering decision-making.
